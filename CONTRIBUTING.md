# Contributing Guidelines

## Workflow
- Use a PR-only workflow; direct commits to main are not accepted.
- Keep PRs small and focused.

## Running Locally
```sh
# add local run commands here
```

## Secrets
Do not commit secrets or credentials. Use environment variables or secret managers.

## Governance and Auditability
Changes that impact governance must be auditable. Use append-only logs or versioned records to preserve history.
