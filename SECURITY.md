# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately. If GitHub Security Advisories are enabled for this repository, use that feature to submit a report. Otherwise, email: security@yourcompany.example.

## What to Include
Provide a clear description of the issue, affected components, reproduction steps, impact assessment, and any suggested mitigations. Include relevant logs, proof-of-concept code, or screenshots when appropriate.

## Response Timeline
We will acknowledge reports as soon as practical and provide status updates as we triage and investigate.

## Safe Harbor
We support good-faith security research. Please avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption, and allow reasonable time for us to remediate before public disclosure.
